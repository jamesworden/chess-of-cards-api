# Pre-Push Verification Report

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Branch**: Current development branch preparing for GitHub push
**Repository Visibility**: Public

## Executive Summary

This document verifies the repository is safe to push to public GitHub by checking:
1. No sensitive information exposed
2. Environment separation between dev and prod
3. GitHub Actions deployment configuration

## 1. Sensitive Data Verification ✅ PASS

### Checked Items

**Configuration Files**: ✅ Clean
- `samconfig.toml`: Only contains build/deploy settings, no credentials
- `.gitignore`: Comprehensive coverage for .NET projects, excludes sensitive files
- No hardcoded AWS credentials found in codebase

**Documentation References**: ✅ Safe
- `DEPLOYMENT.md:276-277`: References to `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are documentation only
- These instruct users to configure secrets in GitHub, not actual credentials

**Code Files**: ✅ Clean
- No connection strings found
- No API keys found
- No database passwords found
- No secret keys hardcoded

**GitHub Actions**: ✅ Secure
- Uses `${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}` and `${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}`
- Credentials sourced from GitHub Secrets (not committed to repo)
- Proper environment-based secret isolation (dev/prod)

### Verdict: SAFE TO PUSH
No sensitive information detected in the repository.

---

## 2. Environment Separation ✅ PASS

### DynamoDB Table Naming

All DynamoDB tables use the `${Environment}` parameter for proper isolation:

```yaml
ConnectionsTable:
  TableName: !Sub "chess-of-cards-connections-${Environment}"

PendingGamesTable:
  TableName: !Sub "chess-of-cards-pending-games-${Environment}"

ActiveGamesTable:
  TableName: !Sub "chess-of-cards-active-games-${Environment}"

GameTimersTable:
  TableName: !Sub "chess-of-cards-game-timers-${Environment}"
```

### Environment Configuration

**Development Environment**:
- Parameter: `Environment=dev`
- Tables: `chess-of-cards-*-dev`
- Stack: `ChessOfCardsApi-Dev`
- Deployed from: `develop` branch

**Production Environment**:
- Parameter: `Environment=prod`
- Tables: `chess-of-cards-*-prod`
- Stack: `ChessOfCardsApi-Prod`
- Deployed from: `main` branch

### Lambda Function Environment Variables

All Lambda functions receive environment-specific table names:
```yaml
Environment:
  Variables:
    CONNECTIONS_TABLE: !Ref ConnectionsTable
    PENDING_GAMES_TABLE: !Ref PendingGamesTable
    ACTIVE_GAMES_TABLE: !Ref ActiveGamesTable
    GAME_TIMERS_TABLE: !Ref GameTimersTable
```

### Verdict: PROPERLY ISOLATED
Dev and prod environments have complete separation with no cross-environment data access possible.

## 3. GitHub Actions Deployment ⚠️ REQUIRES ACTION

### Current Configuration Analysis

**Build Job**: ✅ Configured Correctly
- Triggers on push to `main` or `develop`
- Uses `sam build --use-container --mount-with WRITE`
- Uploads artifacts for deploy jobs

**Dev Deployment Job**: ✅ Configured Correctly (with prerequisites)
- Condition: `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'`
- Environment: `dev`
- Uses proper AWS credentials from secrets
- Deploys with `--parameter-overrides Environment=dev`

**Prod Deployment Job**: ✅ Configured Correctly (with prerequisites)
- Condition: `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`
- Environment: `prod`
- Uses proper AWS credentials from secrets
- Deploys with `--parameter-overrides Environment=prod`

### Required Actions Before First Deployment

#### 1. Create GitHub Environments
In your GitHub repository settings, create two environments:

**Dev Environment**:
- Name: `dev`
- Add secrets:
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your dev AWS access key
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your dev AWS secret key

**Prod Environment**:
- Name: `prod`
- Add protection rules (recommended):
  - Required reviewers
  - Deployment branch: `main` only
- Add secrets:
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your prod AWS access key
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your prod AWS secret key

#### 2. Create S3 Deployment Bucket
The workflow references `chess-of-cards-api-artifacts` bucket:

```bash
# Choose ONE option:

# Option A: Let SAM create the bucket automatically (recommended)
# Remove the --s3-bucket parameter from .github/workflows/main.yml
# Replace line 68 with:
#   --resolve-s3 \

# Option B: Create bucket manually
aws s3 mb s3://chess-of-cards-api-artifacts --region us-east-1
```

#### 3. AWS Region Configuration
All deployments use `us-east-1` region:
- `.github/workflows/main.yml:60` (dev AWS credentials)
- `.github/workflows/main.yml:71` (dev deployment)
- `.github/workflows/main.yml:95` (prod AWS credentials)
- `.github/workflows/main.yml:106` (prod deployment)

**Status**: ✅ Configured correctly for `us-east-1`

### Deployment Flow

Once prerequisites are complete:

1. **Push to `develop` branch** → Triggers dev deployment
2. **Push to `main` branch** → Triggers prod deployment
3. **Manual trigger**: Use "Actions" tab → "Run workflow"

### Verdict: FUNCTIONALLY CORRECT - Prerequisites Required

The GitHub Actions workflow is properly configured and will work correctly once you:
1. Add GitHub environment secrets for AWS credentials
2. Either let SAM auto-create the S3 bucket or create it manually
3. Verify the AWS region matches your preferences

## Action Items Checklist

Before pushing to public GitHub:

- [x] ✅ Verify no sensitive data in repository
- [x] ✅ Verify environment separation exists
- [x] ✅ Remove legacy REST API from template.yaml
- [x] ✅ Add legacy folder to .gitignore
- [x] ✅ Configure workflow to use --resolve-s3 (auto-creates S3 bucket)
- [x] ✅ Set AWS region to us-east-1 throughout workflow
- [ ] ⚠️ Create GitHub environment `dev` with AWS secrets
- [ ] ⚠️ Create GitHub environment `prod` with AWS secrets

## Deployment Testing Plan

After pushing and configuring secrets:

1. **Test Dev Deployment**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git push origin develop
   # Monitor Actions tab for deployment progress
   ```

2. **Verify Dev Resources**:
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name ChessOfCardsApi-Dev
   aws dynamodb list-tables | grep "chess-of-cards.*-dev"
   ```

3. **Test Prod Deployment** (after dev verification):
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git push origin main
   # Monitor Actions tab for deployment progress
   ```

4. **Verify Prod Resources**:
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name ChessOfCardsApi-Prod
   aws dynamodb list-tables | grep "chess-of-cards.*-prod"
   ```

## Security Best Practices Applied

✅ **Secrets Management**: AWS credentials stored in GitHub Secrets, not in code
✅ **Environment Isolation**: Separate AWS credentials for dev and prod
✅ **Branch Protection**: Different branches deploy to different environments
✅ **No Hardcoded Credentials**: All sensitive data externalized
✅ **IAM Least Privilege**: SAM uses `CAPABILITY_IAM` for minimal required permissions
✅ **Public Repository Safe**: No private information will be exposed
